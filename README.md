#Tweeter 

A simple bot using Selenium Webdriver that tweets random quotes from the type.fit/api/quotes API, containing over 1600 quotes. The bot is programmed to quote from the account once every 6 seconds, for a total of 5 times. Change the tweet function values to adjust the speed and ammount you want to tweet. Cheers.
